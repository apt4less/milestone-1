## Description

Apartments4Less is a website that shows opportunities for undergraduates and graduates to have housing . We demonstrate a way for college students to easily find cheap apartments around Tallahassee, especially for students who wished to live off campus. This website also provides links for current scholarships for individuals who can’t afford to pay rent or deposit for an apartment. This is a great way for students to spend less time and effort looking for an apartment all while dealing with their school work and personal lives. 
## App Evaluation

- Story: Analyzes users housing request and display scholarship opportunities
- Market: Any student looking for housing and scholarships.
- Habit: This app could be used as-needed by the user depending on when they're looking for new housing or scholarship opportunities.
- Scope: First we would start with finding affordable housing that will accommodate student needs, then find scholarship opportunities. This has potential for use by colleges/ universities nearby and being posted on the institution website.
